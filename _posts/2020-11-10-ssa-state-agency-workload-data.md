The dataset is revised and expanded from 4 to 71 data fields.  It includes monthly data from October 2000 onwards for SSA disability cases that were referred to the state agency for a disability determination.  When first released, initial claims information was available, but now new information is included on reconsideration and continuing disability review cases, with breakouts by claim title (SSDI, SSI) for each case type.  Specific data elements for each state are receipts, end of month pending  counts, decisions, and the number of decisions which were allowances.
