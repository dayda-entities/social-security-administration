This dataset displays our quarterly national TIS call volume for over 45 API languages for fiscal year 2013 onward.  A fiscal year runs from October through September and a quarter is broken into a three-month timeframe within a fiscal year.  We will continue to add a new column to this report at the end of every fiscal year quarter.
