The Social Security Administration (SSA) conducts periodic CDRs to ensure that only those beneficiaries who remain disabled continue to receive monthly benefits. The cases for which SSA does not conduct a timely (3 year) periodic CDR are considered as backlogged until SSA initiates the CDR for those cases.
