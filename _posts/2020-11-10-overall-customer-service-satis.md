This dataset provides data at the national level for overall satisfaction of customers who have used one of the main methods for conducting business with the agency: in-person service in our field or hearing offices or at a Social Security Card Center, telephone service through our National 800 Number or in one of our field offices, or an online service at www.socialsecurity.gov.
