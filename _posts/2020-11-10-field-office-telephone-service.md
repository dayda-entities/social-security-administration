This dataset provides information at the national level by month for federal fiscal year 2013 onward for answer rate and busy rate for calls to our field offices. The data does not include calls that were abandoned while waiting in queue without representative service or overflow calls, which are those callers who wait in queue over the 15 minute maximum wait time without representative service.
