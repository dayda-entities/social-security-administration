This dataset provides historical data for average wait time (in days) from the hearing request date until a hearing was held. This dataset includes data from fiscal year (FY) 1989 through 2010 at the national level.  Data prior to 1989 is not available.  We offer this longitudinal data under our open data program so that members of the public, Congress, advocates, and other interested parties have access to the entire data asset we have for average wait time to a hearing being held.
