A cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of social security beneficiaries age 18-64 receiving disability benefits in active pay status as of June 2005.  The NBS collects data on: 1. work-relevant characteristics of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries; 2.  work-related goals and activities of SSDI and SSI beneficiaries, particularly as they relate to implementation of the Ticket to Work program; and 3.  service use, barriers to work, and perceptions about TTW and other SSA programs designed to help beneficiaries with disabilities find and keep jobs.
