The National Beneficiary Survey (NBS) Round 5 is a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of social security beneficiaries age 18 to full retirement age receiving disability benefits in active pay status as of June 2014. We conducted Round 5 in 2015. The NBS collects data on key health, employment, and socio-demographic factors that contribute to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries' and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients' successful or unsuccessful employment efforts.
