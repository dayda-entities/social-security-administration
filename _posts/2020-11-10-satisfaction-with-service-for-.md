This dataset contains results of Internet Report Card iRequest Survey conducted by mail between April and June 2014 using a brief scannable “report card” style questionnaire.  The survey methodology included sending a pre-notice postcard, an initial questionnaire, and one follow-up questionnaire.  We mailed the questionnaires shortly after the customer used the online application to try to ensure a clear recollection of the experience. The sample in the iRequest Survey segment contained just over 2,200 records drawn from files of successful users.  There were 792 responders from the iMRC sample.
