The NSCF collected data on the health status and functional limitations, health care utilization, health insurance coverage, receipt of services, SSI experience, socioeconomic status of children's households, and housing characteristics of over 8,000 children who were receiving, had received, or were applying for SSI.  The study is limited to the non-institutionalized population in the continental United States (i.e., it does not include residents of Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories).  Data collection began in July 2001 and ended in July 2002.
