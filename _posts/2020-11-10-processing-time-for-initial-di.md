The dataset includes annual data for average processing time and counts of initial disability claims in which there was a medical determination made. The data is broken out by those cases handled by each Processing Center (PC), the total for all PCs, and total claims processed by the agency for all offices. The cases processed by PC8 are international claims. This dataset provides data for federal fiscal year 2012 onward.
